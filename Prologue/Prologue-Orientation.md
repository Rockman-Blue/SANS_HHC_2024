When I first loaded into the game world, I talked to the Elf named Jingle Ringford. Jingle gives me the snowball badge. By clicking the snowball on your avatar, you see your objectives, hints, resources links, and conversations for the HHC.

After getting the snowball badge, Jingle tells me to click on the Cranberry Pi Terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

After following the instructions of typing "answer" in the top prompt and hitting enter. I complete this first challenge, and the prologue is over. Jingle gives me some more info about how the challenge works, then he tells me where to go next.
