# Gold Trophy

When I first load into the game world, I talked to the Elf named Jingle Ringford. Jingle gives me the snowball badge. By clicking the snowball on my avatar, I can see my objectives, hints, resources links, and conversations for the each challenge.

After getting the snowball badge, Jingle tells me to click on the Cranberry Pi Terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

After following the instructions of typing "answer" in the top prompt and hitting enter, completing the first challenge. Jingle gives me some more info about how the event works, then I get told where to go next.
