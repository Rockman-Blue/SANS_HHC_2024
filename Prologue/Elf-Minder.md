After talking to Poinsettia I learn about the Elf Minder game, and get hints for the silver and gold badges for this challenge.

The help screen tells me about basic gameplay elements and mechanics for this challenge. It's a puzzle style game, where you have to guide an elf through each level using various tools. Some tools include:
* Path drawer to direct the direction and motion of the elf.
* A spring, to jump over obstacles.
* A tunnel, to warp between tunnel endpoints.

The game's goal is to guide the elf from the green flag to a checkered flag, but at the same time collecting Crates along the way. Each level has a time limit when you start the level, so the player has to come up with efficient paths to get to complete the objective.

For brevity's sake I won't show each level solution, but proof that I completed each level is below. One tip that was helpful was noticing that if the elf hits an obstacle, like a rock, the elf will just bounce back and move in the opposite direction of the path that led them to the obstacle. Also, rotating the path while the elf was moving is also a good practice for some of the levels.
