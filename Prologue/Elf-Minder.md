After talking to Poinsettia I learn about the Elf Minder game, and get hints for the silver and gold badges for this challenge.

The help screen tells me about basic gameplay elements and mechanics for this challenge. It's a puzzle style game, where you have to guide an elf through each level using various tools. Some tools include:
* Path drawer to direct the direction and motion of the elf.
* A spring, to jump over obstacles.
* A tunnel, to warp between tunnel endpoints.

The game's goal is to guide the elf from the green flag to a checkered flag, but at the same time collecting Crates along the way.

For brevity's sake I won't show each level solution, but proof that I completed each level is below.
