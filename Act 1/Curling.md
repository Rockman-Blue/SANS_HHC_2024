After clicking on "Go to Act I" in the story section of the game menu, I go left to talk to Bow Ninecandle to learn more about the cURLing challenge.

Bow explains the basic concept of curl, a tool that transfers data to and from a server using URLs. I get two hints after talking to Bow:
*  Using the cURL man page at https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html
*  To use cURL's "--path-as-is" option. This controls a default behavior. 

By clicking on the curling setup, I access and interact with the challenge via a terminal. After typing y and hitting enter to start the challenge, I am presented with the first question.

I solve the first question and move onto the next one.
