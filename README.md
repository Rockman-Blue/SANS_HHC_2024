# Intro 

This repository is my submission for the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2024 contest, which is graciously provided to the cybersecurity community by SANS and Counter Hack.

I have different folders for each phase of the challenge (Prologue, Act 1, Act 2, and Act 3). Within each folder is a separate markdown file for each challenge within that phase. 

As of the time of submission, I have completed the following challenges. I was late to the party due to other obligations, but I look forward to continuing to work through Acts 2 and 3 to complete each challenge.
