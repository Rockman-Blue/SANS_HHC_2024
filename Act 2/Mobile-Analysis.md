I go to the Act 2 island in the event's story menu. From there I get a bunch of objectives added to my menu. To start this challenge, I must talk to Eve Snowshoes for more information.

Here's the challenge. Eve built an Android app to test a modern solution to Santa's naughty and nice list. There's two versions of this app, a debug and release version. Eve accidentally left out one child's name on each version, but Eve can't remember who.

My goal is to download both versions of the app as .apk files and look for the missing child's name on both versions. Eve suggests starting with the debug version first to find out which child's name isn't shown in the list in the app. After that I can move onto doing the same for the release version. 

The hint suggests using either of these two tools:
* [apktool](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/releases)
* [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)
